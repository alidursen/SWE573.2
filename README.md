# SWE573.2
This repository contains whole (or at least *most*) body of work that will be Ali Durşen's project for SWE573 course, taught at BoUn in Fall 2018 by S. Üsküdarlı.

This so-called *body of work* contains the code, obviously, but also various documentation: requirements, design, scheduling and plan, issue tracking. These non-code sub-products can be found under Issues, Projects, Wiki sections.

Complete project is expected to host at https://alidursen.github.io/SWE573/ temporarily.
